# create-svelte

## Developing

To run this locally, you need installed:
- [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/) (I used version 18.12.0, later versions
  should be fine)

Once `node` is installed, you can run the project locally with:

```bash
npm install # Install node-specific libraries, only need this once
npm run dev # Start the server
